## Pizza Menu<br>
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It will then calculate a price according to the input information.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game<br>
It's the classic game of tic-tac-toe. The program randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players will go first. Users can decide which token to use and the winner is celebrated with music.

## Calculator<br>
A basic 4 function calculator. The user can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a web version of a calculator.
